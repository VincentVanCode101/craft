Decide on:
    - Controlling the error-flow(use exit in function and trap EXIT with custom cleanup function, or use returns in functions and trap ERR)
    - Make in docker (should I remove Make and substitute the fucntionality with bash scripts?)

- Get Esa to do styling with ncurs
- BATS testing in a docker container
- How to sem-ver? -> How to check for new updates -> How to prompt user to update repo (update script?)
